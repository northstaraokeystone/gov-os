# Gov-OS v6.1 Compression Parameters
# Domain-specific compression thresholds replacing hardcoded 0.75
#
# PARADIGM: Thresholds calibrated from real data distributions per domain
# Each domain has different baseline variance - one threshold doesn't fit all

thresholds:
  # Fallback threshold for unknown domains
  default: 0.75

  # DoD logistics - high variance in sole-source contracts
  # Source: DoD IG analysis of TransDigm-style pricing
  dod_logistics: 0.55

  # R&D contracts - standard baseline
  # Source: Historical compression analysis of R&D spending patterns
  r_and_d_contracts: 0.75

  # Medicaid claims - tight distribution, fraud stands out
  # Source: GAO-24-106541 improper payment analysis
  medicaid_claims: 0.45

  # Federal real estate - moderate variance in occupancy
  # Source: GSA Federal Real Property Profile 2024
  federal_real_estate: 0.60

  # Defense shipbuilding - high variance, long procurement cycles
  dod_shipbuilding: 0.65

  # Personnel costs - tight distribution
  personnel: 0.50

calibration:
  # Method for computing threshold from data
  method: "percentile_90"

  # Minimum samples required for calibration
  min_samples: 100

  # Days before recalibration required
  recalibrate_days: 30

  # Bounds to prevent invalid calibration
  threshold_min: 0.10
  threshold_max: 0.95
